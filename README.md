# Neovim Configuration Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository! This repository houses my personal Neovim setup, including all the configurations, plugins, and custom scripts I use to enhance my development environment. Neovim is a highly customizable text editor that enables efficiency and productivity for developers, and through this repository, I aim to share my optimized setup with the community.

The primary goal of this repository is to not only track my personal Neovim configuration journey but also to serve as a resource for others looking to customize their Neovim setup. Whether you're new to Neovim or an experienced user, you'll find valuable insights and tools here to elevate your coding experience.
